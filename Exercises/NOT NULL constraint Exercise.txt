Using ALTER TABLE, first add the NULL constraint to the headquarters_phone_number field in the “companies” table,
 and then drop that same constraint.

alter table companies
change column headquarters_phone_number headquarters_phone_number varchar(255) NOT NULL;

alter table companies
modify headquarters_phone_number varchar(255) NULL;
