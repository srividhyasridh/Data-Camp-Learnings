Using DBs and Tables:

Use the same SELECT statement structure as the one shown in the lecture to select all records 
from the “sales” table. Do it twice – 
once specifying the name of the database explicitly in the SELECT statement, and once, without that specification.

select * from sales;

select * from sales.sales;
