Drop the “customers” table, and then recreate it using the following code.

CREATE TABLE customers (

    customer_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,

    first_name VARCHAR(255),

    last_name VARCHAR(255),

    email_address VARCHAR(255),

    number_of_complaints INT,

PRIMARY KEY (customer_id)

);

Then run the following code that will add a “gender” column in the “customers” table, 
and will then insert a new record in it. Don’t worry if you don’t understand the meaning of the code
 perfectly – we will discuss these structures later on in the course in more detail. 
We will just use them now to insert a row in our “customers” table.

 ALTER TABLE customers

ADD COLUMN gender ENUM('M', 'F') AFTER last_name;

 

INSERT INTO customers (first_name, last_name, gender, email_address, number_of_complaints)

VALUES ('John', 'Mackinley', 'M', 'john.mckinley@365careers.com', 0)

;
